# SQLite3.js

A simple to use SQLite3 module, that requires virtually no knowledge of SQL-Queries, while still allowing manual input of SQL-Queries. This module uses the [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/JoshuaWise/better-sqlite3) library by [JoshuaWise](https://github.com/JoshuaWise) and is thus also completely synchronous.

## Install

```cli
npm install --save sqlite3.js
```
